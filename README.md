# An App to Create Workouts

Welcome to my in-progress workouts application! This is a project I am challenging myself to complete in a single weekend. I'm in the beginning stages, but here are some of the features to come:

MVP:

- User can create "workouts", which are a series of exercises with appropriate rep and set counts.
- User can read, edit, and delete these workouts, to complete the CRUD process.

Reach Features:

- Users will be authenticated and taken to their workouts
- User can see workouts created by other users.

# Technology Being Used

For this project, I have chosen to go with a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This was a fairly arbitrary decision as I wanted to practice with the MERN stack. My hope is to learn the ins-and-outs of MERN so that I can compare with other popular stacks and be able to better understand the pros and cons of various technologies.

So, expect some other simple apps utilizing various stacks soon!
